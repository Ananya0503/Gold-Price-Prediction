# Gold-Price-Prediction
Introduction

Gold is a valuable asset and its price is influenced by various factors including economic conditions, interest rates, and geopolitical events. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict gold prices based on historical data. The goal is to provide a model that can assist in understanding price trends and making informed decisions.

Features

Preprocessing of historical gold price data.

Feature selection and engineering for improved model performance.

Implementation of machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regressor.

Performance evaluation metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).

Dataset

The dataset contains historical data of gold prices along with features like:

Date

Gold Price

Macroeconomic Indicators (e.g., inflation rate, interest rate)

Currency exchange rates

Note: Ensure the dataset is properly formatted and preprocessed before running the code.

Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

NumPy

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Tools: Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Ananya0503/Gold-Price-Prediction.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd Gold-Price-Prediction

Install the required libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Open the Jupyter Notebook (gold_price_prediction.ipynb) or Python script.

Load the dataset into the project.

Run the preprocessing steps to clean and prepare the data.

Train the model using the provided algorithms.

Evaluate the performance of the model.

Visualize the results for better insights.

Results

The trained model achieves the following metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): value

Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): value

Graphs and plots will be provided to show the predicted vs. actual gold prices.

Future Work

Incorporate additional features such as global market indices and commodity prices.

Experiment with advanced algorithms like Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks.

Deploy the model as a web application for easy accessibility.
