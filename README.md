# Gold-Price-Prediction
#Introduction

Gold is a valuable asset and its price is influenced by various factors including economic conditions, interest rates, and geopolitical events. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict gold prices based on historical data. The goal is to provide a model that can assist in understanding price trends and making informed decisions.

#Features

-Preprocessing of historical gold price data.

-Feature selection and engineering for improved model performance.

-Implementation of machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regressor.

-Performance evaluation metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).

#Dataset
The dataset contains historical data of gold prices along with features like:
-Date
-Gold Price
-Macroeconomic Indicators (e.g., inflation rate, interest rate)
-Currency exchange rates

#Technologies Used
-Programming Language: Python
-Libraries:
NumPy
